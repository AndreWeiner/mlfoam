# How ton contribute to this repository

We appreciate all efforts contributing to advance data-driven modeling with OpenFOAM, may it be shared research projects, blog posts or links to software projects.

## Research projects, articles, and educational material

A general requirement for all types of listed resources is that they are **freely accessible** for everyone.

### Requirements for educational material

We consider blog posts, videos, online courses, and similar content to fall into this category. To avoid bloating the link collection, the following requirements should be fulfilled:

- the content should have a minimum length of about 1000 words (blog posts), 2min (videos), or 1h (courses); these values are not set in stone but provide only a rough orientation
- the content should be original, e.g., not an aggregation of images/animations/quotes/videos of other resources
- the content should be centered around OpenFOAM **and** data

### Requirements for software and research projects

Projects involving data-driven modeling and OpenFOAM are naturally software-heavy. Therefore, research and software projects should fulfill the following requirements:

- the project should be hosted on a publicly accessible service like GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, etc.
- the repository should contain a README.md file providing essential information:
  - the project's scope
  - installation and usage instructions
  - **research**: summary of the main results
  - **software**: reference to available use cases
- there should be at least one practical demonstration how to use the project/software/library
- pure software content should have a minimum length of ~1000 lines

Ideally, software-centric projects should also provide:

- documentation of source code and use cases
- a software container
- validation
- unit-testing
